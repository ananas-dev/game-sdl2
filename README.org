* Project
** Structure
| src     | source files       |
| include | include files      |
| game    | implementation     |
| libs    | external libraries |

** Build system
The project uses CMAKE to generate build files, the configuration can be found in [["./CMakeLists.txt"][CMakeLists.txt]].
* Engine
** Library
There are 2 libraries used by the game:
    - [[https://www.libsdl.org/][SDL2]]
    - [[https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/][SDL_image]]

* Game
** Structure
The game folder is where the implementation is done,
for the moment it contains only [[./game/main.cpp][main.cpp]] but it will become more complex later.
